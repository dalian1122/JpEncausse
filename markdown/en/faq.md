## Plugins Issues

### Plugin fails the installation
   
It's a known bug related to GitHub.

* Try again several times
* Or try to manually install the plugin that has been downloaded into the `/temp/` folder of SARAH

### Server is broken

If there is an error message in the server window saying `module not found` then it means there is an error with the plugin (either with the JavaScript `.js` file or the `.prop` file). Try to contact the plugin developer.

### I cannot configure the plugin

* There is a known bug with Internet Explorer, Firefox and others... In that case you'll have to use Chrome.
* Some touch devices, like LeapMotion, can conflict with the Portal Drag and Drop.
